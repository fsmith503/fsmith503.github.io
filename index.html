                   Hi, I'm Franklin Smith, a software engineer working at apple on the iCloud Apple Accounts and Authentication Automation team. I was born and raised in Portland, Oregon. Now I live in San Jose California. I love creating software built on iOS/macOS frameworks and technologies, objective-c, swift, and python. I love reading books, playing chess, solving rubix cubes, swimming, running, going on spontaneous adventures, snowboarding trips with close friends, and stretching the limits of technology. My favorite way to start the day is a workout at 5:00 am. My favorite athletes are james stewart, lewis hamilton, nico harrison, deanthony thomas, and tiger woods. My dream vacation would be the monaco formula 1 grand prix or swimming with turtles in the ocean in hawaii. My favorite movies are the dark knight, iron man, james bond, home alone, starwars, Toy story, and joker. My favorite tv shows are jimmy neutron, atypical, greek, younger, and friends. 
                   <br>
                   I have been a happy person ever since January 8th, 2017 when I no longer had social media accounts. I'd used social media since about 2011, and it seems to me that 6 years of social media is plenty for one lifetime. Social media is a good thing for people whose role in life is to be on top of things. But not for me; my role is to be on the bottom of things. We have a growing amount of research which tells us that if you spend large portions of your day in a state of fragmented attention — where your regular workflow is constantly broken up by taking frequent breaks to just check in with social media  that this can permanently reduce your capacity for concentration. What I do takes long hours of studying and uninterruptible concentration and deep work. Deep work is classified as professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limits.

                  <h4>William Schoeffler - Friend</h4>
                  <h4>CEO & founder of Instashowing</h4>
                  <p style="font-size:15px"> Schoeffler, a 22-year-old senior at the University of Oregon, has recently launched an online tool for real estate brokers that he believes will make it easier for them to schedule their home showings, and by extension, ease the shopping process for home buyers.
				Instashowing, the online tool Schoeffler developed, allows real estate agents to schedule times to view a home. Once a time is scheduled, agents and the buyer meet to view the home. The tool, which has a free version, is essentially designed to help agents stay organized and save time.
				Instashowing formed in his head as a business plan, but Schoeffling had no prior experience in real estate or building applications and websites.
				So the student-turned-entrepreneur scoured Upwork and Fiverr websites for help and connected with freelancers to assist with the coding aspect of the project. He funded the development of the web application with a $5000 grant from the University of Oregon business school and money from school scholarships.
				Even with hurdles in the way, including Schoeffler’s age and COVID-19, the company’s growth has been steadily increasing. In August, the site had 525 weekly active users and by November that number had grown to 857.
				Schoeffler hopes to keep the ball rolling after he graduates in December. He envisions more products to expand his fledgling company but the long-term goal is to help a housing market that is plagued with high costs and shrinking opportunities.
				“Housing really is the most foundational aspect of people’s lives,” said Schoeffler. “I hope I can work to make a big impact, tackling some of the most intricate problems in real estate. This will help people live better lives, whether that is with my company or at another.”

Harrison, a Montana State University alum, played college basketball, which led him to professional basketball in Belgium. Returning to the states, Harrison was named an NBA representative for Nike and worked with players such as Tim Duncan, Tony Parker, Manu Ginobili, and Kobe Bryant. Harrison, one of the most respected men in the NBA business and college basketball, has continued to climb the ladder. Harrison is a popular and successful person in the industry that many look up to and try to emulate. His rise to where he is today is admirable, but Harrison is not done, Nico Harrison will continue to build on a stellar resume and continue to be one of the most influential people in the league. Nico Harrison never relishes a moment to teach basketball or the business of sports to any young aspiring athlete or businesspeople. He has shown love to train the next generation and help others reach their goals.

                  <h4>Apple Human Factors Engineer</h4>
                  <p style="font-size:15px"> Kristi’s team works closely with the hardware and software designers to optimize the user experience.While in graduate school, Kristi explored the role of aesthetics in human experience and performance. It helped her understand just how much design can make technology more approachable and usable. Today, she brings this passion to her work as a Human Factors lead in Apple’s Industrial Design group.
                  	Bauerly completed her B.S.E. degree in industrial engineering at Iowa and went on to the University of Michigan where she earned an M.S.I.E. and Ph.D. in industrial and operations engineering. During her graduate studies, she broadened her interests into engineering aesthetics and product design optimization that considers user experience. Bringing a data-driven approach to designing for humans was a natural extension of Bauerly’s research, so she joined Apple in 2006 and has never turned back.
					For every Apple product, she and her teammates consider how the hardware and software design influences the user experience. On Apple Watch, for example, they obsess over details like how the product fits the wrist and how easy it is to put on and take off. On iPhone, they work to ensure that the interface and Multi-Touch display both respond to the user intent, no matter how the device is being held

He started his career as a software engineer in New York City Department of Education. Later, he resigned and went on to a contract position in a foundation and ended up as being jobless.
					Later, he joined Google as software developer and continued to work there until he developed Claim it!. The key idea was to cut out the middle man and thus the expenditures. In 2016, the Claim it! became the first African American-founded company to present at the innovators lab at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Gates starred in Apple First TV series ‘Planet of the Apps’ alongside Jessica Alba.

					After graduating, Deddrick started his career in professional sports in Portland, Oregon as the Assistant Director of Sports Communications for the Portland Trailblazers. It was in that  capacity that he created Portland’s first player development program which addressed development off the court in  business and philanthropy. During that time, Deddrick honed his negotiating skills by securing various endorsement deals with players and agents or business managers.
					Following his stint with the Portland Trailblazers, Deddrick created his own management company, Fazn Inc. With his first  and most noteworthy client, six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O’Neal, Deddrick was instrumental in the negotiations of O’Neal’s seven year $126 million contract with the Indiana Pacers and was the lead negotiator of his multi-year, multi-million-dollar deal with Nike.
					In 2013, Deddrick and Lewis Curry merged their management companies into what is now known as Continuum Management Group LLC. Rooted out of the same principles of Fazn Inc., CMG provides a safe place for professionals to secure, explore, and succeed in their respective field by providing professional services and counsel to clients.
					Deddrick lives in Carmel, IN with his wife Jennifer, and sons Deddrick Jr. and Jaylin.

                            <p>Co-Programmed with my wonderful classmate <a href="https://kaitlyniswright.wixsite.com/kaitlynw">Kaitlyn Wright</a>
                            software for our iOS application <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/friend-maps/id1442017567#?platform=iphone">Friend Maps</a> in Swift, currently available on the apple iTunes app store. My direct role 
                            in this project included creating, maintaining, and deploying the <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">Firebase Google Cloud Developers Real Time Database Infrastructure</a>. It was my responsiblity to implement the iOS features of user accounts, creating accounts with a profile photo, adding friends,
                            and sorting this data with 500 Millisecond request response time from the user interface. <BR>
                            <a href="https://kaitlyniswright.wixsite.com/kaitlynw">Kaitlyn</a> played a principal role in the project by programming all of the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit">Map Kit</a> features
                            and the ability to search and sort for friends/users in the data base from a text input field user request. These features include adding and getting users 
                            location coordinates on the app, connecting with different users. GPS Algorithm design with mapkit geolocation to search and identify businesses. Custom profile,
                            user, and business annotations. Also integrating the  <a href="https://developer.lyft.com/docs/ios-lyft-button">Lyft widget feature </a> which provides users with live ridesharing
                            price quotes to their midpoint or selected friend/business location destination using the API.
                            <BR>
                            Friend Maps allows you to add your friends to your map network, select them on your map, and choose fun meetup points, locations, and establishments around you, them, or the halfway point between the two of you. Friend Maps provides maps and business directories to users. We packaged together the entire process of ride sharing. Headed to the airport? Date night? Or, uh, fishing? Our built in Lyft api can get you a ride in minutes, wherever you’re headed, with the click of a button.

                            With an emerging rise of Dev Ops technology like Docker and other application containers comes an underlying challenge that has been plaguing the computer industry for years, how to efficiently learn and use the technology in a timely manner. Most users are tired of long and meaningless online tutorials and videos which shove irrelevant information down the throat of the consumer. I have solved this problem by programming a shell script that automates the dev ops process with docker while allowing the user to interact and choose where, what, and how they would like to learn about the technology. With a computer execution run time of 2-3 minutes, one can now learn to: set up their docker environment; build an image and run as one container;  scale their application to run multiple containers; distribute their application across a cluster; stack their services by adding a back end database; and deploy their application to production.<a href="https://github.com/fsmith503/ComputerScience/tree/master/FranklinSmithDockerTutorialScript"> Available for download here</a>.
